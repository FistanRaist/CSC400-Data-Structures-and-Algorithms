Feedback Response

The feedback received for the CustomLinkedList assignment was:
- Refine error handling in readFromFile method to provide more formal logging or specific user feedback instead of just printing to System.err.
- Ensure delete method handles the case where data to be deleted is not present by returning a boolean indicating success or failure to make behavior more explicit.

Changes Implemented
To address the feedback, the following changes were made to the source code:
- CustomLinkedList.java:
  - Modified readFromFile method to throw a custom FileProcessingException with detailed error messages for IOException and NumberFormatException, replacing System.err.println.
  - Added FileProcessingException class to encapsulate file-related errors with specific messages.
  - Updated delete method to return a boolean indicating whether deletion was successful.
  - Modified deleteNonHead method to return a boolean indicating if the data was found and deleted.
  - Updated main method to check return value of delete and print feedback if deletion fails.
These changes improve error handling robustness and make the delete operation's outcome explicit, enhancing the usability and reliability of the CustomLinkedList ADT.
