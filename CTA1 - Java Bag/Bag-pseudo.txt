BAG DATA STRUCTURE PSEUDOCODE

• Set up the Bag
  - Make a HashMap called 'items' to keep track of stuff and how many times it shows up.

• Add something
  - Look if the thing is already in items.
    - If it’s there, add 1 to its count.
    - If not, give it a count of 1.

• Take something out
  - Check if the thing is in items.
    - If it is:
      - If there’s only 1, get rid of it.
      - If there’s more, just subtract 1 from its count.

• See if something’s there
  - Say true if the thing is in items, false if it’s not.

• Count how many of something
  - If the thing’s in items, say its count.
  - If not, say 0.

• Show what’s in the bag
  - Start a StringBuilder with "Bag{".
  - For each thing in items:
    - Add the thing, a colon, its count, and a comma.
  - If there’s stuff in items, chop off the last comma.
  - Finish with "}".
  - Give back the StringBuilder as a string.

• Show it working
  - Make a new Bag.
  - Toss in: "Fighter’s Honed Broadsword", "Cleric’s Blessed Amulet", "Fighter’s Honed Broadsword", "Mage’s Arcane Orb", "Thief’s Shadow Key", "Cleric’s Blessed Amulet".
  - Print what’s in the bag.
  - Say if "Fighter’s Honed Broadsword" is there.
  - Say if "Goblin Skull" is there.
  - Say how many "Fighter’s Honed Broadsword"s.
  - Say how many "Cleric’s Blessed Amulet"s.
  - Take out one "Fighter’s Honed Broadsword".
  - Print the bag again.
  - Say if "Fighter’s Honed Broadsword" is still there.
